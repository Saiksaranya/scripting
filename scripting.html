                <p>A scripting language or script language is a programming language for a runtime system that automates the
                    execution of tasks that would otherwise be performed individually by a human operator. Scripting
                    languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled.A scripting language's primitives are
                    usually elementary tasks or API calls[clarification needed], and the scripting language allows them to
                    be combined into more programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include application
                    software, text editors, web pages, operating system shells, embedded systems, and computer games. A
                    scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case
                    of scripting an application, it is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also
                    sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they sometimes operate at a high
                    level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes.</p>
            </li>
            <p>There are many scripting languages some of them are ,</p>
            
                <li>
                    <p>bash: It is a scripting language to work in the Linux interface. It is a lot easier to use bash
                        to create scripts than other programming languages. It describes the tools to use and code in
                        the command line and create useful reusable scripts and conserve documentation for other people
                        to work with.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Node js: It is a framework to write network applications using JavaScript. Corporate users of
                        Node.js include IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Yahoo for real-time web applications.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ruby: There are a lot of reasons to learn Ruby programming language. Rubyâ€™s flexibility has
                        allowed developers to create innovative software. It is a scripting language which is great for
                        web development.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Python: It is easy, free and open source. It supports procedure-oriented programming and
                        object-oriented programming. Python is an interpreted language with dynamic semantics and huge
                        lines of code are scripted and is currently the most hyped language among developers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Perl: A scripting language with innovative features to make it different and popular. Found on
                        all windows and Linux servers. It helps in text manipulation tasks. High traffic websites that
                        use Perl extensively include priceline.com, IMDB.</p>

                    <p>A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements
                        in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output.
                        Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to
                        implement algorithms.Machine language- Machine language is a type of low-level language that
                        computers can understand easily. They are composed of instructions in binary or hexadecimal and
                        are the elemental language of computers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines
                        that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> All programming languages are not scripting languages
                        It generates a exe file.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Some popular examples are C, C++, Java, Scala, COBOL, etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It is comparatively difficult to write code in a programming language, and
                        it requires numerous lines of code for each task.
                        The development time in programming languages is high as more lines are
                        required.It is used to develop an application or software from scratch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>As it uses a compiler, hence the complete program is converted into
                        machine code in one shot.
                        These languages are required to be compiled.
